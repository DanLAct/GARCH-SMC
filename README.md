# GARCH-SMC
Efficient Bayesian estimation for GARCH-type models via Sequential Monte Carlo


The code contained here implements SMC for estimating and predicting the GARCH, GJR-GARCH, and BEGE model investigated in the paper. The implementation of MCMC for estimating the BEGE model is also provided.  

Each subfolder provides script files which are instructions for running each of the methods on real data and simulated data are provided.
