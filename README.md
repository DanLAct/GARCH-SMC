# GARCH-SMC
Efficient Bayesian estimation for GARCH-type models via Sequential Monte Carlo


The code contained here implements SMC for estimating and predicting the GARCH, GJR-GARCH, and BEGE model investigated in the [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03828). The implementation of MCMC for estimating the BEGE model is also provided.  

Each subfolder provides script files ‘Run_estimation’ and ‘Run_prediction’, which are instructions for running each of the methods on real data and simulated data.
